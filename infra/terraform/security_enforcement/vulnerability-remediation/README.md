# Automated Response: NVIDIAScape (CVE-2025-23266) Remediation on AWS

To be transparent, I had this built and then once I saw the limitation and the cost I decided to hold off but this was my tentative plan. 

# Goal 
Serverless, event‑driven workflow that detects and remediates CVE‑2025‑23266 in Amazon EKS using Amazon Inspector → EventBridge → Lambda (container image).

# Key ingredients

1. PoC exploit (poc.c → poc.so) compiled into a container.

2. Dockerfile for the exploit image with LD_PRELOAD=/poc.so.

3. ECR pipeline – build, tag, push; nodes pull from ECR.

4. Vulnerable GPU node

5. G5 xlarge Amazon Linux 2.

6. Toolkit pinned to nvidia‑container‑toolkit 1.17.7; OCI hook left enabled (disable‑cuda‑compat‑lib-hook = false).

7. Kubernetes manifest – privileged pod, hostPath /, GPU request, runtime nvidia.

8. Deploy kubectl apply -f nvidiascape-pod.yaml; PoC writes to /owned on the host.

9. Detect – Amazon Inspector runtime finding triggers an EventBridge rule.

10. Automate – EventBridge invokes a Lambda container that:

- patches the node (sets hook to true & restarts Docker),

- quarantines / deletes offending pods via kubectl or Kyverno Helm chart.

- Status – Design complete but paused due to cost/quota concerns; infrastructure not deployed yet.

# Conclusion 
This captures the end‑to‑end flow without the full implementation detail you provided.
